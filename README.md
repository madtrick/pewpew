### Shooting

Shots have the same direction and rotation as the player who took the shot. Their initial coordinates will be calculated so that the shot perimeter is tangential to the permiter of the player.

Shots will be destroyed when they:

* hit one of the arena walls
* Hits (touches) the perimeter of one of the players (the player and the shot are tangential)
